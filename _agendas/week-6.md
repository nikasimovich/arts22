- [Today&rsquo;s Notes](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Penn-Week-6b-Fan-Page-Kick-Off-CSS-Animations--BcCGV980E~DzHTnaI1URPSECAQ-OmgDTYiXZ1OVa1b3iEZjo)
- Introduce Fan Page
- Topic vs. Story

### Homework
- Complete the CSS Animation activity and submit on Canvas
- Read [In Defense of the Poor Image – Hito Steyerl](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/10/61362/in-defense-of-the-poor-image/), Paris will be the discussion leader, everyone else will [respond on the document](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Penn-Art-of-Web-S22-Reading-Reflections--BbJ6T5rVvfWn94KhpzZhFNXUAQ-1UUZlQIbgmKjouZ5Tl2TE).
- Prepare two different pitches for your Fan Page project. Create a short presentation (Google slides, Figma, or PDF) that introduces each subject. Please include a visual representation, your interest in the subject, potential aspects you could focus on, and why this is worthy of a fan page in 2022. Be sure to think about how your subject is a story rather than a topic – one way of doing this is thinking about the subject as being active (for example, ikebana is a topic; but ikebana artists creating work during the pandemic becomes more of a story).

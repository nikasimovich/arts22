### Overview
<p style="clear: both;">
  <img src="../assets/images/hello-world.gif" width="100" class="syllabus-img">&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; is frequently the first phrase used when learning a new programming language. When programmers see this word on a screen, it means that their code worked, indicating a success. As an introduction to our class, create a gif that will serve as your &ldquo;hello world.&rdquo; What is the first feature you&rsquo;d like to share about yourself with our group? Craft a short, visual depiction about yourself in form of an animated gif and upload it to canvas.

### Consider
- Your animation does not need to include the words "Hello World" but it can if you&rsquo;d like.
- Consider what message you&rsquo;d like to share with the class and explore different ways of visualizing that. You could try something typographic, photographic, collage...
- While I&rsquo;d like the gif to reflect something about yourself, it does not need to be overtly autobiographical. Your design decisions say a lot about yourself.

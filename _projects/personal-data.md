### Overview
Data is everywhere. It exists in many formats and is a powerful storytelling tool. Data visualizations often compliment the written word or use a combination of graphic design and statistics to extend a narrative. Many data visualizations are charts or bar graphs, but data visualizations can take any form. For this assignment, you’ll develop a web-based visualization about either yourself or a community that you have access to.

As a class, we'll explore biases in data visualizations, algorithms and technology. We’ll explore different ways of image-making and evaluate how our graphics can meaningfully tell a narrative. We’ll explore the data collection process by collecting our own data and thinking through how to best organize it. We’ll then use that data to develop a form that can be viewed in multiple formats and consider how the visualization tells different stories through interaction.

In class, we&rsquo;ll look at ways to use JavaScript to sort and highlight your data. Your project can take any web-based form, however, and is not required to use JavaScript. The most important aspects of the project are that your data tell a complete story, and the visual design and interactions are considered and supportive.

You should collect the data on your own, and can use any media to visualize it.
